# Lilith: A 2.5D First Person Shooter in Unity

This project is a simple first person shooter created in Unity and coded in C#. It utilizes sprites rather than 3D models to represent objects in the game world, much like early 90's shooters such as Doom and Marathon. It has basic features such as player movement (jumping, crouching, etc.), enemy AI (monsters and turrets), and shooting.

## Introduction

My goal with Lilith was to give myself an opportunity to learn both Unity and C#. I had programmed many small games in the past in programs such as Game Maker and Unreal Engine, so this time I wanted to create a first person shooter to challenge myself. Thankfully there are many resources for learning Unity online, and I have cited the tutorials I used in my code. All of the assets used in the game were created by me.
